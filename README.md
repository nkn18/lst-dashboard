# LST Dashboard

A modern dashboard to compare yield and liquidity provision (LP) opportunities on Bifrost and other LST protocols, powered by real-time data from the DeFiLlama API.

## Features

- ü§ñ **LST Insight Agent:** Ask questions about LSTs, protocols, and yields using the built-in AI agent (powered by Vercel AI SDK and DeepSeek).

## Data & Updates

- All data is sourced from the [DeFiLlama API](https://defillama.com/).
